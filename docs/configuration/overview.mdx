# Configuration Overview

Every project requires a `melos.yaml` project in the root. The below outlines
all of the configurable fields and their purpose.

## `name`

> required

The name of this project, using for display purposes within IO environments and IDEs.

```yaml
name: My Awesome Project
```

## `packages`

> required

A list of local packages Melos will use to execute commands against.  The list can be
of specific paths or a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern expansion format.

```yaml
packages:
  # e.g. all packages inside the /packages directory
  - packages/**
  # e.g. including the workspace root as a package
  - '*'
```

> You can can also reduce the scope of packages on a per-command basis via the [`--scope` filter](/filters#scope) flag.

## `ignore`

> required

A list of local packages Melos will ignore when executing commands in the workspace.  The list can be
of specific paths or a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern expansion format.

```yaml
ignore:
  # e.g. ignore example apps
  - 'packages/**/*example'
```

> You can can also expand the scope of ignored packages on a per-command basis via the [`--scope` filter](/filters#scope) flag.

## `scripts`

> optional

Define custom scripts that can be executed in the workspace via the [`melos run`](/commands/run) command.

Learn more about defining scripts [here](/configuration/scripts).
